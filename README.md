# 🦠 Virginia COVID Data API

## 🚩 Purpose

This project allows users request information regarding Virginia's COVID information via API calls. The driver of this project is to practice Node.JS skills learned in [Jonas Schmedtmann's Node.JS Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/), though this project is of my own design.

## 🔴 Description

This project allows users to make API calls to a URL. The API will return various information regarding Virginia's COVID case, hospitalization, and death rate. A variety of statistics calculated from this data will be available as well.

The data for this project is retrieved from the [Virginia Open Data Portal](https://data.virginia.gov/). The dataset link can be found [here](https://data.virginia.gov/Government/VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-Cases_By-Age-Group/uktn-mwig). This API will have routines that pull the most recent data in order to keep the DB size small. Data will be stored in MongoDB.

## 🔵 Requirements

Create a RESTful API that can be called upon using standard URL queries. Create a routine that will populate the DB with new information and purge the DB of old information. Provide API routes that can be accessed that allow clients to see aggregated information and statistics generated using the dataset.

## 🟢 Usage

Usage documentation will be provided as the project progresses. Planned API calls include:

- Cases by:
  - Age
  - City
  - State (Total)
- Stats:
  - Death Rate / Age Group
  - Death Rate / Hospitalization

## ✅ Results

Will be populated as project progresses.

# 🚀 Installation

Will not require installation.
